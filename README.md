# tailbeatTracking

This is a bit of Matlab code that I wrote to track the location and body position of fish. The code is not very well commented, but I am happy to share it as a few people were asking.

This code uses the library dipimage, so you will need to install this library first:
http://www.diplib.org/
(also check for dipimage licence)

The folder images_High_Def_Fish_Motion contains some images that can be used for testing. In principle it is also possible to read a video directly, but to make this example as simple as possible here I have already exported some frames that will be read one by one as images.

Set your running directory in Matlab to the folder where you download the Matlab scripts
Run the analyse_all.m without any parameters. This should work on the images provided in example (at least it worked on my computer today).

If you have any questions, perhaps the easiest thing is if you ask me directly.
