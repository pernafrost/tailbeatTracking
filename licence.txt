All scripts that I wrote (all those for which no author is specified) are free to reuse for whatever purpose, but you may need to check the licence of dipimage as this code relies on that library. If you use the function distm and sinfamp, check the header at the beginning of these functions for credits to the authors and when applicable licence terms.
